Tasks:

● Create a Node class as shown above.

● Fill in the constructor method that sets the Value to a given number and Next to null of your Node objects.

● Create a SinglyLinkedList class as shown above.

● Create a constructor method that sets the Head to null of your SinglyLinkedList objects

● Create a Remove() method that will remove a node from the end of your list

● Create PrintValues() method that will print all the values of each node in the list in order

Optional Challenges:

● Implement a Find(int) method that will return the first node with the value in the parameter

● Implement a RemoveAt(int) method that will remove the node after n nodes, where n is the parameter. For example, if n is 0, remove the first node. If n is 1, remove the second node (similar to arrays).
